"During routine checks, a severe structural defect was detected that compromises the durability of the product. Electrical malfunctions were also observed, indicating a design flaw that could lead to operational failures. Given the high rate of defects, urgent corrective measures need to be implemented before proceeding with manufacturing. As the issue presents a potential hazard, distribution of the batch has been halted pending further investigation.",Major Issues
"After conducting multiple quality checks, the product has been found to meet all regulatory standards. Structural integrity and functionality were verified at different stages of production. The final assessment shows no defects, ensuring that the batch is ready for distribution. All components are well-assembled, and no anomalies have been detected during the inspection.",Compliant
"A critical failure was identified in the batch, where a key component was found to be malfunctioning under standard testing conditions. Further analysis revealed severe material contamination, making the product unsafe for use. This defect poses a high safety risk, requiring immediate recall of the affected units. The batch has been rejected, and production has been halted until corrective actions are implemented.",Major Issues
"While inspecting the batch, it was observed that some products had a minor label misprint. Additionally, a few units had slightly uneven adhesive application, but the structural integrity remains intact. No functional defects were detected, and all core performance aspects met the required standards. These minor issues do not impact the usability of the product, and the batch remains valid for sale.",Minor Defects
"During the quality inspection, slight discoloration was observed on a few units, but it remains within acceptable limits. Minor surface imperfections such as scratches were found, though they do not affect the product's core functionality. A small misalignment in assembly was noted, but it does not hinder overall performance. The batch remains suitable for shipment as the identified issues are cosmetic in nature.",Minor Defects
"The batch has undergone thorough inspection, and no defects were found in any of the units. All quality control parameters have been met, and the final assessment confirms compliance. Routine testing indicates that the materials used match the required specifications. There are no deviations from the established manufacturing guidelines, ensuring product reliability.",Compliant
